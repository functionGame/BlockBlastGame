# BlockBlastGame
This is the code to the game created in the video titled, "So I made BlockBlast! at home....", on the youtube channel game().

To use this code, you should run python with the pygame library installed. The file will also create a new file titled "highscore" to save all of the score that you have played on your own device.

Enjoy!
